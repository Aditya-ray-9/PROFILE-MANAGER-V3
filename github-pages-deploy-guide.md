# GitHub Pages Deployment Guide for Profile Manager

## How to Deploy Without the "#" Redirection Issue

Follow these steps to properly deploy your Profile Manager to GitHub Pages without experiencing the incorrect redirection:

1. **Copy Files to Root Directory**
   - Make sure that your main `index.html` file is in the root directory of your repository, not in a subdirectory
   - The `.nojekyll` file must be in the root directory to tell GitHub Pages not to process your site with Jekyll

2. **Use the Static HTML Approach**
   - Your repository should have this structure:
     ```
     - index.html (landing page)
     - .nojekyll
     - 404.html (custom error page)
     - client/
       - index.html (your app)
       - ...other app files
     ```

3. **Use Direct Links Without Hash Routing**
   - In your navigation, use direct links to HTML files rather than hash-based routing
   - Example: Use `href="profiles.html"` instead of `href="#/profiles"`

4. **GitHub Repository Settings**
   - Go to your repository's Settings > Pages
   - Set the source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select the "main" branch and "/" (root) folder
   - Click Save

5. **Custom Domain (Optional)**
   - If you have a custom domain, add it in the GitHub Pages settings
   - Create a CNAME file in your repository with your domain name

## Troubleshooting

- If you still see a 404 error, check that your repository name exactly matches what's in the URL
- Ensure you've committed and pushed all files, including the `.nojekyll` file
- GitHub Pages can take a few minutes to update after pushing changes
- Test your site using the GitHub Pages URL: `username.github.io/repository-name`
- Try clearing your browser cache if you're still having issues

By following these steps, your Profile Manager app should work correctly on GitHub Pages without any unwanted hash redirects.
